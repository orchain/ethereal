// GasPriceForBlocks attempts to calculate a suitable gas price for a transaction given the gas used and the number of blocks
// within which the transaction is desired to be included in.  It does this by looking back over a number of blocks to calculate
// the gas price that would have been required.
// This generally assumes that miners are rational in their selection of transactions to include in blocks, specifically that they
// select the highest gas price transactions available to them.  An obvious exception to this assumption is transactions generated
// by the miners themselves, for example by a mining pool to pay out their miners.  Due to this, blocks that contain self-mined
// transactions are excluded.
// As with any algorithm that uses historic information to calculate future values there are no guarantees that the resultant value
// will provide the desired result; significant changes to gas price between transactions in prior blocks and those in the
// transaction pool can result in an over- or under-estimation of the required gas.
